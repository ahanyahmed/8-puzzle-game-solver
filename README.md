## 8-Puzzle Solver Using AI Algorithms

### The 8-Puzzle Solver is a Python application that employs artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle involves arranging numbered tiles in a 3x3 grid with one blank space, aiming to reach a target configuration from an initial state through sliding movements.

### In this assignment, I implemented several AI search algorithms to solve the puzzle efficiently. These algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and two variants of the A* search algorithm: A* Manhattan and A* Euclidean. Each algorithm aims to find the optimal solution by exploring the puzzle state space intelligently.

### Additionally, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly platform for inputting the initial puzzle state, selecting the desired algorithm, and visualizing the solving process. The GUI displays the puzzle state using buttons arranged in a grid, allowing users to navigate through the solution states and observe the algorithm's progress.

### The 8-Puzzle Solver serves as an educational tool for understanding and applying AI algorithms in solving combinatorial puzzles. By implementing and integrating these algorithms into a cohesive solution, the project demonstrates the power of AI techniques in tackling real-world problems and provides insights into algorithmic efficiency and optimization.
